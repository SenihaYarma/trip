	<h1>Decisions</h1>
	<h3>Without thinking the real life choose your path. Just have fun!!</h3>
		<p>While you are working in the office a worker comes and tells you that someone wants to talk with you. You head to the lobby with curiosity and see one of your client. She asks if you have time she want to talk with you something and you go to a cafe. After making the casual talk she tells you seeing you work so hard and stressed wanted her to help you. So, she offers you a trip. A trip that you plan. You just have to give her the plan and she says she will sponsor. She says that lets plan now together if it is okay with you. With the shock you say yes and she asks when do you want to go in SUMMER OR WINTER?</p>
