	<h1>Decisions</h1>
	<h3>Without thinking the real life choose your path. Just have fun!!</h3>
		<p>While I was working in the office a worker came and told me that someone wants to see me. I headed to the lobby with curiosity and saw one of my clients. She asked me "If you have time I want to talk with you something? We could go to a cafe." After making the casual talk she told "Seeing you work so hard and in stress wanted me to help you. So, I am offering you a trip. A trip that you plan. You could just give me the plan and I will sponsor. If you want we could decide couple things. When do you want to go in SUMMER OR WINTER?"</p>
